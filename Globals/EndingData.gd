const PERFECT_ENDING_BODY: String = "You deserve this, my friend.
We've made it home. You were too good for this world, and its frozen hate.
I rest now, knowing your soul will pass on to a world without this biting cold.

I know we will meet again, another time, another space."

const GOOD_ENDING_BODY: String = "I'm sorry I couldn't return all of you.
But you should know your sacrifice protected the both of us.
Thank you for helping me in this journey.
It would have been too difficult otherwise.

I'm sure you understand."

I know not of these limits of your faith, but I hope what I have brought is enough to make up for it.

I’m sorry, {PERISHED_ONE}"

const TERRIBLE_ENDING_BODY: String = "I survived. Yet, what was the point without any of your remains. 
I failed in my mission. I used everything at my disposal to survive.
Now, you are scattered, lost, and desecrated.

It wasn’t supposed to be this way. I’m sorry, {PERISHED_ONE}."

{PERISHED_ONE}’s spirit drifts through the wasteland, alone."
const AFTERWORD_TERRIBLE: String = "You are alone. {PERISHED_ONE} is lost."
