const PERFECT_ENDING_BODY: String = "You deserve this, my friend.
We've made it home. You were too good for this world, and its frozen hate.
I rest now, knowing your soul will pass on to a world without this biting cold.

I know we will meet again, another time, another space."

const GOOD_ENDING_BODY: String = "I'm sorry I couldn't return all of you.
But you should know your sacrifice protected the both of us.
Thank you for helping me in this journey.
It would have been too difficult otherwise.

I'm sure you understand."

const BAD_ENDING_BODY: String = "The burden of this journey was great. More than half of you is lost.
I know not of these limits of your faith, but I hope what I have brought is enough to make up for it.

I’m sorry, {PERISHED_ONE}"

const TERRIBLE_ENDING_BODY: String = "I survived. Yet, what was the point without any of your remains. 
I failed in my mission. I used everything at my disposal to survive.
Now, you are scattered, lost, and desecrated.

It wasn’t supposed to be this way. I’m sorry, {PERISHED_ONE}."

const DEAD_ENDING_BODY: String = "A body lies limp in the snow.
Crows pick at the meat left after days of harvest for other scavengers.
A sliver of silver peaks from the remains.
The pack is empty.
Whatever was once here has been taken. 
No one will remember this traveler. 
They are simply one of many, and they will not be the last"

const AFTERWORD_GOOD: String = "You light the candles, honoring %s’s passing."
const AFTERWORD_BAD: String = "You have survived. 
{PERISHED_ONE}’s spirit drifts through the wasteland, alone."
const AFTERWORD_TERRIBLE: String = "You are alone. {PERISHED_ONE} is lost."
const AFTERWORD_DEAD : String = "The Ice takes you"
